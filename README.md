## Overview
This project examines how differing business models shape privacy practices:  
- **Apple**: device-first revenue model, stronger focus on privacy by design.  
- **Meta (Facebook)**: ad-driven business, broad cross-platform data collection.  
- **Google**: product ecosystem + ads, balancing convenience with pervasive reach.  

The analysis compares **what data is collected**, **how it is collected**, **user choice**, **with whom it is shared**, **policy language**, and **regulatory alignment** under GDPR/CCPA.

### ðŸ“Œ Note on Scope
While frameworks such as **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and other major sector-specific privacy laws exist, they were **not included in this projectâ€™s comparative analysis**.  

The focus here is limited to **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) and **CCPA/CPRA** (California Consumer Privacy Act / Privacy Rights Act) as primary benchmarks for evaluating Apple, Meta, and Googleâ€™s privacy policies.
